# sass-boilerplate

Sass partials updated to latest version of Sass.

Due to the introduction of Sass Modules in **2019**, there are several rules and common used features that are becoming deprecated.

## Installation:

Use terminal to install the latest version of sass into your system. [https://sass-lang.com/install](https://sass-lang.com/install)

I used:

```
brew install sass/sass/sass
```

Note: I had to remove a previous version of sass from my system after installing it due to conflicting files

```
rm '/usr/local/bin/sass'
```

## Basic Compilation options:

### Terminal:

```
sass -w --style=compressed [scss file name]:[css file name]
```

## Get Started

```
yarn dev
```

### VSCode extension:
